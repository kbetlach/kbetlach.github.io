# Kyle's Bootcamp Repo

(https://github.com/kbetlach/kbetlach.github.io)

Welcome to my University of Minnesota coding bootcamp project repo!

Inside this repo you will find various assignments and projects I completed throughout the bootcamp. They range from full MERN stack applications, like the Fitness Tracker and Google Book Search, to simple CLI Node.js applications like the PDF Generator and Employee CMS. 

The bootcamp was a full stack development program, focusing on the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React.js, Node.js), as well as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and responsive web design.

Inside each assignment folder you'll find a detailed read me file explaining what each application sets out to accomplish.

Thanks for stopping by!
