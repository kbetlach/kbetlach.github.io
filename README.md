# [Kyle's Bootcamp Repo] (https://github.com/kbetlach/kbetlach.github.io)

Welcome to the U of M coding bootcamp repo of Kyle Betlach!

Here you will find a constantly changing and evolving repo that will become filled out with the various homework assignments I will be completing for the bootcamp.

Homework01: Portfolio: For homework assignment 1, we were tasked with creating a professional portfolio for our work. For more information and to see the finished portfolio, click the "homework01" folder. Made with html and css in VS Code.

Homework02: Remade portfolio. For this assignment, we were asked to remake our portfolio from homework01, but with Bootstrap CSS this time. Looks mostly the same as the portfolio from homework01, but as the screen gets smaller, the content is responsive and will fall into place to still be readable.

Made with html and Bootstrap CSS in VS Code.

Homework03: Password Generator: As part of the JavaScript curruculum, we created a random password generator. The generator will ask users how many characters between 8 - 128 they want in their password, and they can further specify what types of characters will be included (special, numeric, upper or lower case letters). 

As a bonus, there is a functioning copy button that copies the generated password to the user's clipboard for easy pasting. Made with html, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

Homework04: Code Quiz. A working five-question quiz about computer coding. When user's click the start button, the questions start and a 75 second timer begins ticking down. If a question is answered incorrectly, the user is penalized 15 seconds off of the timer. The final score is the seconds remaining on the clock plus the amount of correctly answered questions. 

For now, the assignment is not fully finished as it is supposed to be able to store user scores in local storage. User's should also be able to click the "View Highscores" button and see all the high scores logged in local storage. I intend to complete this at a later date.

Made in VS Code with html, css, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.

Homework05: Workday Planner. Timeblocks are laid out to represent a work day from 9 am to 5 pm. User's can enter a task in any of the time blocks and click the save button. The input will save into local storage, and upon refreshing the page, whatever was stored there will generate.

Made in VS Code with html, css, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.

Homework06: Weather Dashboard. A functioning weather dashboard that allows users to search any city in the world and have the current weather conditions generate. Additionally, a five day forecast will generate as well. Any city searched will have a button created to the side of the page that says the name of the city. Clicking any generated buttons will re-display that city's weather information. User city searches / buttons are stored in local storage. Weather data is generated from the Open Weather API.

Made in VS Code with html, css, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and the Open Weather API.
