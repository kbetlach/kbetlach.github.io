# [Kyle's Bootcamp Repo] (https://github.com/kbetlach/kbetlach.github.io)

Welcome to the U of M coding bootcamp repo of Kyle Betlach!

Here you will find a constantly changing and evolving repo that will become filled out with the various homework assignments I will be completing for the bootcamp.

Homework01: Portfolio: For homework assignment 1, we were tasked with creating a professional portfolio for our work. For more information and to see the finished portfolio, click the "homework01" folder. Made with html and css in VS Code.

Homework02: Remade portfolio. For this assignment, we were asked to remake our portfolio from homework01, but with Bootstrap CSS this time. Looks mostly the same as the portfolio from homework01, but as the screen gets smaller, the content is responsive and will fall into place to still be readable.

Made with html and Bootstrap CSS in VS Code.

Homework03: Password Generator: As part of the JavaScript curruculum, we created a random password generator. The generator will ask users how many characters between 8 - 128 they want in their password, and they can further specify what types of characters will be included (special, numeric, upper or lower case letters). 

As a bonus, there is a functioning copy button that copies the generated password to the user's clipboard for easy pasting. Made with html, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
