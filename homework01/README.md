# Homework01: Professional Portfolio

##Introduction

This is the first homework assignment for the U of M coding bootcamp. It is a professional portfolio for myself, made by myself. The idea is that it will evolve as I complete projects and need somewhere to stage them and show people. For now, it is just a shell, to be filled out later!

###Technologies

The portfolio was created in VS Code using exclusively html and css. We followed specific layouts and css stylings provided by the Readme in the homework folder.

####Launch

Nothing too fancy! Simply open it up with your favorite web browser to view it!

#####Status

The shell of the portfolio is for the most part complete, but there are no other projects on display in the "Portfolio" section so in a way, that aspect is still "in development." As I create more, they will be added to this section for display.

######Sources and Inspiration

My favorite bits of code in this project are specifically the buttons in the top right of the heading. 

</div>    
<div class="headerbutton"><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></div> 
<div class="headerbutton"><a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a></div> 
<div class="headerbutton"><a href="index.html">About</a></div>
</div>

Making buttons like these that actually function and move between the pages was brand new to me, and really satisfying to create. Styling them was also really fun and satisfying.

.headerbutton {
position: relative;
right: 125px;
float: right;
margin-top: 20px;
margin-right: 50px;
align-items: center;
font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
color: #4aaaa5;
width: 50px;
font-size: 16px;
}

a:link {
text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
color: inherit;
}

It was interesting to style buttons to not be underlined, and to modify their "visited" states in order to retain their teal color.

We talked a bit about this in class, but I relied pretty heavily on w3schools for additional information on how to achieve the result I got.

Also, a massive shoutout to the TAs Blake, John and Johnny for helping me troubleshoot some issues I was having!
