    <p>Hi! Thank you for stopping by my portfolio! My name is Kyle Betlach, and I'm currently a student enrolled in the University of Minnesota computer coding cohort. I have a background in archaeology and religious studies, but decided to change directions and pursue full stack development.
        I decided to get into coding as a way to pursue my interest in technology, as well as find a way to flex my creative muscle.
    </p>

    <p>In my freetime, my hobbies include tabletop board gaming, watching the Minnesota United soccer team play, listening to music, and spending time with friends and my girlfriend Ashley. I'm a lifelong resident of Minnesota, and a proud resident of Saint Paul.</p>

    <p>I was really drawn to computer coding because of its ever evolving nature, and how much there is to learn. I hope that over time my portfolio will be ever evolving as well, reflecting the many steps I will be taking in this new pursuit.  
        What I hope you'll find in my portfolio is my dedication to creativity, as well as my passion and drive and constant desire to improve.
    </p>
