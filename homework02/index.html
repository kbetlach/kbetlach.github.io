                <p>Hi! Thank you for stopping by my portfolio! My name is Kyle Betlach, and I'm currently a student enrolled in the University of Minnesota computer coding bootcamp. I have bachelor's degrees in anthropology and religious studies from Hamline Unversity, 
                    and have spent my working life bouncing around between the natural foods industry, archaeology, and board game distribution. I recently decided to change direction and pursue full stack development.
                    I chose to get into coding as a way to pursue my interest in technology, in addition to having an outlet to flex my creative muscle.
                </p>
            
                <p>In my freetime, my hobbies include tabletop board gaming, watching the Minnesota United soccer team, listening to music, and spending time with friends and my girlfriend Ashley. I'm a lifelong Minnesotan, and a proud resident of Saint Paul.</p>
            
                <p>I was really drawn to computer coding because of its ever-evolving nature, and how much there is to learn. I hope that over time my portfolio will be ever-evolving as well, reflecting the many steps I will be taking in this new pursuit.  
                    What I hope you'll find in my portfolio is my dedication to creativity, as well as my passion, drive, and constant desire to improve.
                </p>
