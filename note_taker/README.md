# Express Note Taker

# Introduction

As part of the Express curriculum, we created a note taking app using Express routing and methods to record, display, and delete notes. The front end HTML and JavaScript was provided, and we were tasked with developing the backend code.

The user is able to create a note title, and a body of the note, then click the save button to append the note to the left side of the screen. The user can create as many notes as they'd like. After the server is turned off and back on, the notes will persist and repopulate upon refresh. The user can delete any note they want by simply clicking the delete button.

# Sources and Inspiration

I thought this was an interesting assignment! It was fun to create Express routes and push things into a db.json. My favorite bits of code are here:

Doing the detective work and figuring out how to make the post and delete routes was satisfying and fun to figure out.
