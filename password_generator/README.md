# Random Password Generator

Deployed: (https://kbetlach.github.io/password_generator/)

## Introduction

For this assignment, we were meant to create a password generator using JavaScript. The generator will ask users how many characters between 8 - 128 they want in their password, and they can further specify what types of characters will be included (special, numeric, upper or lower case letters). 

The purpose of the application is to provide the user with a secure, randomized password.

## Technologies

The generator was created in VS Code using html, css, Bootstrap and JavaScript. 

## Sources and Inspiration

I found this assignment to be fairly difficult, but shoutouts to the TAs, especially Blake for pushing me through it. I was able to cobble together most of what I needed, and Blake helped push it over the edge into functioning properly.

My favorite bit of code is honestly the whole JavaScript portion. Making this out of nothing felt like quite the achievement for me personally since I had been struggling to wrap my mind around JavaScript for so long. The for loop is probably what I'm most proud of:

I also watched this video a handful of times of someone creating a password generator using a slidebar, which I found pretty interesting and gave me some ideas.
