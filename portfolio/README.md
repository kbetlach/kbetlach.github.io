Portfolio

Deployed link: (https://kbetlach.github.io/portfolio/)

##Introduction

For the bootcamp, we were tasked with creating and periodically updating a professional portfolio so we could practice design, and then use it in the future for job hunting.

The objective was to display a headshot alongside a short about me section, a gallery of my completed coding projects, and a contact section with ways to get in touch with me and links to other social media platforms.

The completed projects have links to the deployed application, as well as the GitHub repos they live in, so users can view them and access the READMEs for each individual project. 

Designed with mobile first in mind, this portfolio should scale and adjust itself no matter the screen size or device the user is viewing it with.

###Technologies

The portfolio was created in VS Code using html, css, Bootstrap, Animate.css, and Font Awesome. 

####Launch

Nothing too fancy! Simply open it up with your favorite web browser to view it!

#####Status

The portfolio, for now, is complete. The idea is that it will evolve over time as more projects are completed and ready to be staged in the gallery.

Check back in the future to see what projects I've added to keep up with what I'm doing!

######Sources and Inspiration

I really enjoy updating this page. It's fun and satsifying to show off things I've worked on, and as someone who really likes design, it's good practice to play with the portfolio and get it to a place I'm happy with.

This time around, I had a lot of success using Font Awesome icons for external websites like GitHub and LinkedIn. Here's a snippet of what the code looks like in my navbar:

 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-betlach"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in" id="linked"></i></a>
<a href="https://github.com/kbetlach"><i class="fab fa-github" id="git"></i></a>
   
Super simple, but looks really clean and streamlined on the page. 

This was my first time also messing around with Animate.css, and it was also really straightforward to get the fade in effects to work for each of my portfolio pages.
