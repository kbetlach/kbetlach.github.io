## Welcome!

This is my professional portfolio! This started as one of our earliest coding bootcamp assignments and has grown from there. We were tasked with updating it periodically throughout the 6 month program.

Upon bootcamp completion, I decided to use a free template I found online to make it look cleaner and snappier, and I'm really happy with the outcome. (Link to template provided above).

This portfolio is single page, and as the user scrolls down they will find a short about me section, my skills, a 6 panel projects gallery with screenshots and links to some of my work, my resume, and finally a contact section for ways to get in touch with me.

This is a page I will continually update with projects as time goes on, so feel free to stop back!
