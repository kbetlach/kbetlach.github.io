# Weather Dashboard

# Introduction

Homework06 asked us to create a weather dashboard. Users should be able to enter a city and then have the current weather conditions of that city displayed. Additionally, a five day forecast for that city will also display. All weather data is meant to be generated from successfully tapping into the Open Weather API. 

After a city is searched, the city is then stored in local storage and a button is created to show what the user has previously searched. Upon refresh, those buttons should be visible, and once clicked, the weather data re-generated.

# Technologies

The dashboard was created in VS Code using html, css, Bootstrap, jQuery, and the Open Weather API. 

# Launch

Nothing too fancy! Simply open it up with your favorite web browser to view it!

# Sources and Inspiration

Fun assignment! Had a good time exploring an API and using its data. I think my favorite part is I finally got some local storage stuff to work! For some reason this has been eluding me over the past couple assignments, but I got it working this time. Here's the code that has the buttons generate themselves to the page on refresh:

It has definitely made me more comfortable in knowing when and how to use for loops as well.

As always, a big thanks to all the TAs who helped me out!
